Emacs mode for editing HP42s code.

* Installation
  Place [[file:./hp42s-mode.el][hp42s-mode.el]] in a convenient directory,
  e.g. =~/.emacs.d/lisp/= and add that directory to your Emacs load
  path:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp"))
  #+END_SRC
  Then add
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'hp42s-mode)
  #+END_SRC
  to your =init.el= and restart Emacs.

  By default, =hp42s-mode= is triggered when visiting a file with the
  extension =.hp42s=.

* Known limitations/ideas
  * Numbers are not font-locked yet, due to collision with =LN1+X=.
  * It would be nice to have some kind of automatic translation from
    e.g. =R^= to =R↑= when starting a new line.
